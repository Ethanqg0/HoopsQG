# HoopsQG: Automated Content Generation 🏀

## About 🤖
With a love for basketball and skills in HTML/CSS designing, I created HoopsQG, my Instagram account dedicated to NBA content. It utilizes templates that I've crafted in HTML and CSS.

To streamline the content creation process, I developed a web scraper. This web scraper grabs data from NBA.com about the winners of games and their best players. I then set up a cron job for scheduling respectful web scraping and had all data put into a template engine to generate my posts.

## Features 🌟
- **Scheduled Web Scraping:** Utilizes scheduled web scraping techniques to fetch real-time NBA game results, player performances, and other relevant data from trusted sources.
- **Template Engine Integration:** Harnesses the capabilities of a template engine to dynamically populate post templates with scraped content, ensuring consistency and visual appeal across all posts.
- **Automation and Efficiency:** Automates the generation and publishing of Instagram posts, reducing manual intervention and streamlining the content creation workflow for @HoopsQG.
- **Customization Options:** Offers customization options for post formats, templates, and content sources, enabling tailoring to the specific preferences and requirements of the Instagram page.

## Notes 📝
As I continue using this for content generation, I may turn it into a public API for the future. For now, I will use it only for my account. If you are interested, please visit @HoopsQG on Instagram. 😊
